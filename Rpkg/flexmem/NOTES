(bug)
During package init, we need to deal with location of default
symbols in a better way. See these notes in the code:
 * XXX Instead of RTLD_NEXT, we should explicitly locate the default
 * calls in libc. For example, if we called this init routine from
 * within another dyanmic library, the initialization could fail.

(tuning)
Realloc right now allocates a new file, copies over contents from
old one, deallocates old one. This should be improved (just extend
old file length).

(note)
We allocate in page sized chunks because that's what mmap does on
Linux at least.
