Use the EXM_HOME environment variable to set the path to the libexm.so library.
Quick example:

```
make
EXM_HOME=$(pwd) ./exm <program> [program arguments]
```

Or install into the default location of /usr/local/:

```
make
sudo make install
exm <program>
```

Optionally `make CFLAGS=-DDEBUG` to enable basic log messages to stderr and the
system log.  Optionally `make CFLAGS=-DDEBUG1` to enable more verbose log
messages to stderr and the system log.

Exm defaults to using the TMPDIR environment variable to store data.  Use the
TMPDIR variable or the exm_path API function to dynamically change the data
path.


# API Documentation

See api.c for a list of API functions. There is no library per se, function
symbols need to be looked up by the calling program. See test.c for examples.

Important parameters can be set by environment variables:

TMPDIR         temporary file directory (for allocations)
EXM_THRESHOLD  allocation threshold in bytes (default=2147483648 aka 2GB)
EXM_CHILD_COW  forked process memory sharing control (integer), default=1
               <= 0 means MAP_SHARED parent/child shared writable map
               1    means MAP_PRIVATE (in-core child COW)
               2    means copy backing file first for child
               3    reserved for future use

See exm.c/init()  for more details on these settings. All parameters
can be changed dynamically with the API functions in api.c.
