Use the EXM_HOME environment variable to set the path to the libexm.so library.
Exm defaults to using the TMPDIR environment variable to store data.  Use the
exm_path API function to dynamically change the data path.
Quick example:

```
make
EXM_HOME=$(pwd) ./exm <program> [program arguments]
```

Or install into the default location of /usr/local/:

```
make
sudo make install
exm <program>
```

Optionally `make CFLAGS=-DDEBUG` to enable basic log messages to stderr and the
system log.  Optionally `make CFLAGS=-DDEBUG1` to enable more verbose log
messages to stderr and the system log.

See api.c for a list of API functions. There is no library per se, function
symbols need to be looked up by the calling program. See test.c for examples.
